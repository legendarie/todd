# T.O.D.D

Welcome to T.O.D.D! T.O.D.D is a fun, adventurous puzzle game that will progress according to a series of 
decisions made by the player. In completing the journey, the player will encounter
numerous puzzles. The final goal of the game? Hit start and you will find out!

## Getting Started

The player will be guided through the storyline via lines of text, displayed in the dedicated
textbox. Click on the text box for the next line of text. When there are decisions to make,
buttons will appear. Intuitive? Yes. Easy? Probably. Watch out for Easter eggs, though. We won't 
tell you where to click.
